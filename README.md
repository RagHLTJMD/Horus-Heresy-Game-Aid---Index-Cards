# Horus Heresy 2nd Edition Index Cards
The goal of this project is to crowd-sourced a collection of index cards to enable an easier time both playing 30k and also to help bridge more players over from 10th Edition 40k. The index cards have been one of the greatest additions to the game and it's about time they were expanded to the other game systems.

# What is an Index Card
An index card is a game aid that contains all of a units specific rules, weapons profiles, and special rules. The aim is to give you a hands on referance to all of the relevant rules for your unit/faction to take to your games so you dont have to spend 4 hours flicking through Libre Astartes looking for what Destroyer 2 does again, or how Twin-Linked works in 30k.

# How to Use
Simply download the 2 sided index cards that apply to your army and print them. The recommended size would be A5 but can be printed at whatever desired size.
All cards are vetted before being committed to the repo to ensure they are accurate to the latest GW publications. 

As new rules and factions are added or changed we endevour to update the index cards accordingly. 

# How to get involved
Download the template file and add in the desired unit, then push it to the repo and I will vet the card per the source text. If modifications need making I will let you know otherwise they will be committed to the repository.

# What is 30k
Warhammer The Horus Heresy (30k) is a tabletop wargame made by Games Workshop. The Horus Heresy is set in the 31st Millennium where Horus, the chosen Warmaster of the Emperor, fell to the forces of Chaos, turning half his brothers with him, and kicking off the heresy we all know and love.
