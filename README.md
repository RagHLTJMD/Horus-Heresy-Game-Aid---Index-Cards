# Horus-Heresy-Game-Aid-Index-Cards
The goal of this project is to crowd source a collection of index cards to enable an easier time both playing 30k but also to help bridge more players over from 10th Edition 40k. The index cards have been one of the greatest additions to the game and its about time they were expanded to the other game systems. 

# How to Use
Simply download the 2 sided index cards that apply to your army and print them. Recommended size would be A5 but can be printed at whatever desired size.
All cards are vetted before committed to the repo to ensure they are accurate to the latest GW publications. 

# How to get involved
Download the template file and add in the desired unit, then push it to the repo and I will vet the card per the source text. If modifications need making I will let you know otherwise they will  be committed to the repository. 

# What is 30k
Warhammer The Horus Heresy (30k) is a tabletop wargame made by Games Workshop. The Horus Heresy is set in the 31st Millennium where Horus, the chosen Warmaster of the Emperor, fell to the forces of Chaos, turning half his brothers with him, and kicking off the heresy we all know and love.
